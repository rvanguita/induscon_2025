## Repository Contents
- **27-Node System Data.xlsx** – File containing all data used for the simulations and analyses presented in the article.
- **README.md** – Documentation describing the repository and data structure.
- **LICENSE** – License information for the dataset and repository usage.

## `.xlsx` File Description
The **27-Node System Data.xlsx** file is organized into the following sheets, each representing a specific dataset of the power distribution system studied in the work:

- **One-line diagram of the system**: One-line diagram showing the initial topology of the system.
- **System information**: General technical specifications and system-wide parameters.
- **Nodes**: Apparent demand peaks and number of users per node.
- **Branch**: Line length to be built, initial system data, and related parameters.
- **Conductor type**: Resistances, reactances, maximum current, and construction cost for each conductor type.
- **Substation**: Maximum apparent power data for construction/repowering and the costs associated with each of these items.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to publicly and reproducibly provide the original dataset used in the study. Researchers and professionals may use this dataset to replicate the presented results or to conduct new analyses related to expansion planning in distribution systems.
